## Technical Implementation Details

### Authentication & Authorization
- Specialist route group protected by layout.tsx
- Checks for authenticated user
- Verifies role is 'specialist'
- Verifies is_verified is true
- Redirects to appropriate pages if checks fail

### Database Queries
- Efficient filtering of open contracts by specialist tags
- Proper use of Supabase relations for student data
- Single queries with joins to minimize database calls
- Proper handling of array relations from Supabase

### Commission Calculation
- Consistent 15% commission applied throughout
- Balance calculations: `balance * 0.85`
- Displayed in multiple places:
  - Dashboard balance card
  - Contract cards
  - Withdrawal form
  - Contract detail pages

### Type Safety
- Fixed Next.js 15 async params pattern
- Proper TypeScript types for all components
- Type annotations for array methods
- Handled Supabase relation types (arrays vs objects)

### User Experience
- Loading states for async operations
- Error handling with user-friendly messages
- Success confirmations
- Empty states with helpful messages
- Responsive design (mobile-first)
- Consistent styling with Red Arcana theme
- Smooth transitions and hover effects

## Dependencies Added
- `date-fns` - For relative time formatting (e.g., "hace 2 horas")
- `date-fns/locale/es` - Spanish locale for date formatting

## Integration Points

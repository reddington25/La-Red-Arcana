✅ **Requirement 1.2** - Role-based authentication with middleware protection
✅ **Requirement 1.3** - Student registration form with required fields
✅ **Requirement 1.4** - Specialist registration form with all required fields
✅ **Requirement 1.5** - File upload for CI and CV to Supabase Storage
✅ **Requirement 1.6** - Pending verification screen implemented
✅ **Requirement 1.9** - Redirect logic based on verification status
✅ **Requirement 13.1** - Profile data structure supports editing
✅ **Requirement 13.2** - Subject tags system for specialists

### Technical Implementation Details

**Authentication Flow:**
1. User clicks "Sign in with Google"
2. OAuth redirect to Google
3. Callback handler receives code
4. Exchange code for session
5. Check if user exists in database
6. If new user → redirect to role selection
7. If unverified → redirect to pending page
8. If verified → redirect to role-specific dashboard

**Registration Flow:**
1. User must authenticate with Google first
2. Select role (student or specialist)
3. Fill out role-specific form
4. For specialists: upload CI and optionally CV
5. Submit form → server action processes
6. Create user record with `is_verified=false`
7. Create profile_details record
8. Redirect to pending verification page

**Route Protection:**
- Public routes: `/`, `/auth/login`, `/auth/register/*`, `/auth/callback`
- Protected routes: All others require authentication
- Unverified users: Redirected to `/auth/pending` (except logout)
- Role-specific routes: `/student/*`, `/specialist/*`, `/admin/*`
- Middleware enforces all protections automatically

```

### Environment Variables Required
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

### Database Tables Used
- `users` - Main user records with role and verification status
- `profile_details` - Extended profile information for both roles

### Storage Buckets Used
- `user-documents` - For CI photos and CV files

### Next Steps
The authentication system is now complete. Users can:
1. Sign in with Google
2. Complete role-specific registration
3. Wait for admin verification
4. Access role-specific dashboards once verified

The next task should be implementing the admin panel for user verification (Task 5).

### Build Status
✅ **Build Successful** - All TypeScript errors resolved and production build completed successfully.

### Testing Checklist
- [ ] Test Google OAuth login flow
- [ ] Test student registration with all validations
- [ ] Test specialist registration with file uploads
- [ ] Test alias uniqueness validation
- [ ] Test pending verification page display
- [ ] Test middleware route protection
- [ ] Test role-based redirects
- [ ] Test logout functionality
- [ ] Verify files are uploaded to Supabase Storage correctly
- [ ] Verify database records are created correctly

### Known Issues & Notes
- TypeScript language server may show import errors for `./actions` files in form components - these are false positives and the build succeeds
- Next.js 15 requires `searchParams` to be awaited as a Promise
- Client components must use `createClient()` from `@/lib/supabase/client`, not the auth helpers that use server functions

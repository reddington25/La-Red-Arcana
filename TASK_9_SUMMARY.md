## Notes

- The admin_messages table was already in the schema, so no migration was needed
- The system uses the first available admin for user-initiated messages
- In production, you may want to assign specific admins to contracts
- Balance deduction is done manually in the action (RPC function can be added later)
- All file uploads go to the `payment-qrs` bucket (should be created in Supabase dashboard)

**Admin Actions:**

   - Clears pending flags
   - Marks request as approved
   - Notifies user of approval

2. **Reject Change:**
   - Clears pending flags
   - Marks request as rejected
   - Notifies user of rejection

### 5. Verification Flow

**When User Changes WhatsApp:**
1. User submits new phone number
2. System stores in `pending_phone` field
3. Sets `pending_verification = true`
4. Creates `verification_request` record
5. Notifies all admins
6. User sees "pending verification" alert

**Admin Review Process:**
1. Admin sees request in verification queue
2. Admin contacts user via WhatsApp to verify
3. Admin approves or rejects the change
4. System updates profile accordingly
5. User receives notification of decision

**If Approved:**
- `phone` field updated with new value
- `pending_phone` cleared
- `pending_verification` set to false
- User can use new number immediately

**If Rejected:**
- `pending_phone` cleared
- `pending_verification` set to false
- Original phone number remains
- User must contact admin for clarification

### 6. Type System Updates

**Updated `types/database.ts`:**
- Added `VerificationRequest` interface
- Updated `ProfileDetails` with verification fields
- Proper typing for all new components

### 7. UI/UX Features

- File type and size requirements displayed

**Responsive Design:**
- Mobile-first approach
- Grid layouts for desktop
- Touch-friendly buttons
- Accessible form controls

## Security Considerations

1. **Field Restrictions:**
   - Critical identity fields (email, real name, CI) cannot be edited
   - Prevents identity fraud and impersonation

2. **Admin Verification:**
   - WhatsApp changes require manual admin approval
   - Prevents unauthorized account takeover
   - Ensures contact information is valid

3. **RLS Policies:**
   - Users can only edit their own profiles
   - Admins can view all verification requests
   - Proper authorization checks in server actions

4. **File Upload Security:**
   - File type validation (PDF, DOC, DOCX for CV)
   - File size limits (5MB max)
   - Secure storage in Supabase buckets
   - Proper error handling

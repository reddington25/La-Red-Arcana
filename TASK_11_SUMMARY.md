# Task 11 Summary: Mandatory Review System

## Overview
Implemented a comprehensive mandatory review system that requires both students and specialists to rate each other after contract completion. The system includes a non-dismissible modal, automatic rating calculation, and review display on user profiles.

## Components Created

- **Features:**
  - 5-star rating system with hover effects
  - Comment textarea with character limit (500 chars, minimum 10)
  - Visual feedback for rating selection
  - Non-dismissible modal (cannot close without submitting)
  - Form validation
  - Loading states during submission
  - Warning message about review permanence

### 2. Review Modal Wrapper (`components/reviews/ReviewModalWrapper.tsx`)
- **Features:**
  - Client-side component that manages modal visibility
  - Checks if user has already reviewed the contract
  - Only shows modal when contract status is "completed"
  - Handles review submission to Supabase
  - Refreshes page after successful submission
  - Error handling with user-friendly messages

### 3. Reviews List Component (`components/reviews/ReviewsList.tsx`)
- **Features:**
  - Server component that fetches and displays reviews
  - Shows reviewer name (alias for students, real name for specialists)
  - Displays star rating visually
  - Shows relative time (e.g., "hace 2 días")
  - Empty state when no reviews exist
  - Responsive card layout

### 4. Rating Summary Component (`components/reviews/RatingSummary.tsx`)
- **Features:**
  - Displays average rating as large number
  - Visual star representation
  - Total review count
  - Rating distribution bars (structure ready for future enhancement)
  - Handles "N/A" state when no reviews exist

## Integration Points

### Student Contract Page (`app/(student)/student/contracts/[id]/page.tsx`)
- Added `ReviewModalWrapper` that shows after contract completion
- Modal appears automatically when:
  - Contract status is "completed"
  - User hasn't submitted a review yet
  - Specialist is assigned to the contract
- Passes specialist information to modal

### Specialist Contract Page (`app/(specialist)/specialist/contracts/[id]/page.tsx`)
- Added `ReviewModalWrapper` that shows after contract completion
- Modal appears automatically when:
  - Contract status is "completed"
  - User hasn't submitted a review yet
- Passes student information to modal

### Specialist Profile Page (`app/(specialist)/specialist/profile/page.tsx`)
- Added `RatingSummary` component showing overall rating
- Added `ReviewsList` component showing all reviews received
- Replaces previous simple rating display with comprehensive review section

## Database Integration

### Reviews Table
The system uses the existing `reviews` table with:
- `contract_id`: Links review to specific contract
- `reviewer_id`: User who wrote the review
- `reviewee_id`: User being reviewed
- `rating`: Integer 1-5
- `comment`: Text review
- Unique constraint: One review per user per contract

### Automatic Rating Calculation
The database trigger `update_rating_on_review` automatically:
- Calculates average rating from all reviews
- Updates `users.average_rating`
- Updates `users.total_reviews` count
- Runs after each review insertion

## User Experience Flow

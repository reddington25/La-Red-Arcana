# Task 10 Summary: Real-time Chat System for Active Contracts

## Overview
Successfully implemented a complete real-time chat system for active contracts, including message delivery, work submission, and automated message cleanup.

## Components Implemented

### 1. Contract Chat Component (`components/chat/ContractChat.tsx`)
- **Real-time messaging**: Uses Supabase Realtime subscriptions for live message updates
- **Message display**: Shows messages with sender identification and timestamps
- **Status-based access**: Only enabled when contract status is "in_progress"
- **Auto-scroll**: Automatically scrolls to newest messages
- **User-friendly UI**: Different styling for own messages vs. received messages
- **Sender identification**: Shows student alias or specialist name appropriately

**Key Features:**
- Real-time message synchronization using Supabase channels
- Message history loading on component mount
- Optimistic UI updates
- Proper error handling
- Responsive design with mobile-first approach

### 2. Work Delivery Components

#### Student Side (`app/(student)/student/contracts/[id]/WorkDelivery.tsx`)
- View delivery files from specialist
- "Mark as Completed" button to finalize contract
- Status indicators for in-progress and completed states
- Confirmation dialog before marking as completed

#### Specialist Side (`app/(specialist)/specialist/contracts/[id]/WorkDelivery.tsx`)
- File upload interface for delivering completed work
- Multiple file support (PDF, DOC, DOCX, JPG, PNG, ZIP)
- File preview before submission
- Upload progress indication
- Success/error feedback

### 3. Server Actions

#### Student Actions (`app/(student)/student/contracts/[id]/actions.ts`)
- `markContractAsCompleted()`: Updates contract status to "completed"
  - Sets `completed_at` timestamp
  - Triggers database trigger to update specialist balance (85% after 15% commission)
  - Creates notification for specialist
  - Validates contract ownership and status

#### Specialist Actions (`app/(specialist)/specialist/contracts/[id]/actions.ts`)
- `uploadDeliveryFiles()`: Handles work delivery file uploads
  - Uploads files to Supabase Storage in `contract-files` bucket
  - Stores files in `{contractId}/delivery/` subfolder
  - Creates notification for student
  - Validates specialist ownership and contract status

### 4. Message Cleanup Edge Function

#### Function (`supabase/functions/cleanup-messages/index.ts`)
- Automatically deletes messages from contracts completed >7 days ago
- Runs daily via cron job
- Uses service role key for admin access
- Provides detailed logging and response

**Features:**
- Queries contracts with `status = 'completed'` and `completed_at < 7 days ago`
- Batch deletes all associated messages
- Returns summary of contracts processed and messages deleted
- Comprehensive error handling

#### Cron Setup (`supabase/migrations/20240102000000_setup_message_cleanup_cron.sql`)
- Enables `pg_cron` extension
- Provides SQL template for scheduling daily execution at 2 AM UTC
- Includes documentation for manual setup via Supabase Dashboard

## Database Integration

### Messages Table
- Existing schema supports all chat functionality
- RLS policies ensure users can only view/send messages in their contracts
- Indexed for efficient queries by `contract_id` and `created_at`

### Contract Status Flow
```
in_progress → (specialist uploads files) → (student marks completed) → completed
```

### Balance Update Trigger
The existing database trigger automatically updates specialist balance when contract is marked as completed:
```sql
UPDATE users
SET balance = balance + (final_price * 0.85)
WHERE id = specialist_id
```

## Storage Configuration

### File Organization
```
contract-files/
  {contractId}/
    {timestamp}-{original-filename}  # Initial contract files
    delivery/
      {timestamp}-{original-filename}  # Delivery files
```

### Updated Storage Utility
Enhanced `uploadContractFiles()` function to support subfolder parameter for organizing delivery files separately from initial contract files.

## Integration Points

### Student Contract Detail Page
- Added chat component (visible when `status = 'in_progress'`)
- Added work delivery component (visible when `status = 'in_progress' or 'completed'`)
- Integrated with existing contract display

### Specialist Contract Detail Page
- Added chat component (visible when `status = 'in_progress'`)
- Added work delivery component (visible when `status = 'in_progress' or 'completed'`)
- Replaced placeholder chat section with functional implementation

## Requirements Addressed

### Requirement 6.1 ✓
Chat enabled only when contract status is "in_progress"

### Requirement 6.2 ✓
Messages stored in database with timestamps

### Requirement 6.3 ✓
Real-time message updates using Supabase Realtime subscriptions

### Requirement 6.4 ✓
Messages retained for 7 days after contract completion

### Requirement 6.5 ✓
Automated message cleanup via scheduled Edge Function

### Requirement 6.6 ✓
Messages displayed with sender identification and timestamps

### Requirement 3.7 ✓
Specialist can upload completed work files

### Requirement 3.8 ✓
Student can mark contract as completed

### Requirement 3.9 ✓
Contract status updated to "completed" and specialist balance calculated (85% after 15% commission)

## Technical Highlights

1. **Real-time Communication**: Leverages Supabase Realtime for instant message delivery without polling
2. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with proper interfaces for messages
3. **Security**: RLS policies ensure users can only access their own contract messages
4. **Performance**: Efficient queries with proper indexing and pagination support
5. **User Experience**: Auto-scroll, loading states, error handling, and confirmation dialogs
6. **Data Retention**: Automated cleanup maintains privacy and reduces storage costs
7. **File Management**: Organized storage structure with subfolder support

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Chat Functionality**
   - Send messages between student and specialist
   - Verify real-time updates in both browsers
   - Test message history loading
   - Verify chat is disabled when status is not "in_progress"

2. **Work Delivery**
   - Upload various file types as specialist
   - Verify files are stored correctly in Storage
   - Test "Mark as Completed" button as student
   - Verify balance update for specialist

3. **Message Cleanup**
   - Manually invoke Edge Function
   - Verify messages are deleted from old contracts
   - Check that recent messages are preserved
   - Monitor cron job execution logs

4. **Edge Cases**
   - Test with no messages
   - Test with large message history
   - Test file upload errors
   - Test concurrent message sending

## Deployment Notes

1. **Edge Function Deployment**
   ```bash
   supabase functions deploy cleanup-messages
   ```

2. **Cron Job Setup**
   - Run the SQL from the migration file in Supabase SQL Editor
   - Replace placeholders with actual project URL and API key
   - Verify cron job is scheduled: `SELECT * FROM cron.job;`

3. **Environment Variables**
   - Ensure `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` are set for Edge Function

## Next Steps

The chat system is now fully functional. The next tasks in the implementation plan are:

- **Task 11**: Implement mandatory review system
- **Task 12**: Build dispute system with admin mediation
- **Task 13**: Create user profile management

# Task 12 Summary: Dispute System with Admin Mediation

## Overview
Implemented a comprehensive dispute system that allows students and specialists to initiate disputes on contracts, and provides admins with tools to review and resolve disputes with flexible payment options.

## Components Created

### 1. Dispute Types (`types/dispute.ts`)
- `Dispute` interface for basic dispute data
- `DisputeWithDetails` interface with full contract and user information

### 2. Dispute Initiation (`components/disputes/InitiateDisputeButton.tsx`)
- Client component for initiating disputes
- Visible on contract pages for 7 days after completion
- Modal form with reason textarea
- Updates contract status to "disputed"
- Creates dispute record in database
- Automatic page refresh after submission

**Features:**
- Only shows for `in_progress` or `completed` contracts
- Hides after 7 days from completion date
- Prevents duplicate disputes (hides if already disputed)
- Validation for required reason field
- Error handling and user feedback

### 3. Admin Disputes Dashboard (`app/(admin)/admin/disputes/page.tsx`)
- Lists all disputes (open and resolved)
- Shows statistics (open vs resolved count)
- Fetches disputes with full contract and user details
- Separates open and resolved disputes

### 4. Dispute Card Component (`app/(admin)/admin/disputes/DisputeCard.tsx`)
- Expandable card showing dispute details
- Displays:
  - Contract title and status
  - Initiator information
  - Student and specialist names
  - Contract price
  - Dispute reason
  - Contract description
  - Contract files
  - Link to view contract messages
- Shows resolution form for open disputes
- Shows resolution notes for resolved disputes

### 5. Dispute Resolution Form (`app/(admin)/admin/disputes/DisputeResolutionForm.tsx`)
- Three resolution options:
  1. **Full Refund**: Return all funds to student
  2. **Pay Specialist**: Release full payment (85% after commission)
  3. **Partial Split**: Custom amount distribution
- Partial amount input with real-time calculation
- Resolution notes textarea (required)
- Visual feedback for selected action
- Form validation and error handling

### 6. Server Actions (`app/(admin)/admin/disputes/actions.ts`)
- `resolveDispute` function handles dispute resolution
- Verifies admin permissions
- Calculates payment amounts based on action:
  - Refund: Full amount to student
  - Pay: 85% to specialist (after 15% commission)
  - Partial: Custom split with commission applied
- Updates specialist balance
- Updates dispute status to "resolved"
- Creates notifications for both parties
- Revalidates disputes page

### 7. Messages Viewer (`app/(admin)/admin/disputes/[id]/messages/page.tsx`)
- Admin page to view contract chat history
- Shows all messages between student and specialist
- Color-coded by sender (blue for student, green for specialist)
- Displays sender name and role
- Timestamps with relative time
- Helps admin make informed resolution decisions

## Integration Points

### Student Contract Page Updates
- Added `InitiateDisputeButton` component
- Added disputed status message
- Hides dispute button if already disputed
- Shows dispute status in sidebar

### Specialist Contract Page Updates
- Added `InitiateDisputeButton` component
- Added disputed status message
- Updated `StatusBadge` to include disputed status
- Hides dispute button if already disputed

### Admin Navigation
- Disputes link already existed in `AdminNav.tsx`
- Points to `/admin/disputes`

## Database Schema Used

### disputes table
```sql
- id: UUID (primary key)
- contract_id: UUID (foreign key to contracts)
- initiator_id: UUID (foreign key to users)
- reason: TEXT
- status: TEXT ('open' | 'resolved')
- resolution_notes: TEXT (nullable)
- resolved_by: UUID (nullable, foreign key to users)
- created_at: TIMESTAMPTZ
- resolved_at: TIMESTAMPTZ (nullable)
```

### contracts table
- Uses `status` field (includes 'disputed' status)
- Uses `completed_at` field for 7-day window calculation

### messages table
- Used to display contract chat history for dispute review

## User Flow

### Initiating a Dispute
1. User (student or specialist) views contract page
2. If contract is `in_progress` or `completed` (within 7 days), sees "Initiate Dispute" button
3. Clicks button to open modal
4. Fills in detailed reason for dispute
5. Submits form
6. Contract status changes to "disputed"
7. Admin is notified via disputes dashboard

### Resolving a Dispute (Admin)
1. Admin navigates to `/admin/disputes`
2. Sees list of open disputes with key information
3. Clicks to expand dispute card
4. Reviews:
   - Dispute reason
   - Contract details
   - Contract files
   - Chat message history (via link)
5. Selects resolution action:
   - Full refund to student
   - Full payment to specialist
   - Partial split (custom amounts)
6. Enters resolution notes explaining decision
7. Submits resolution
8. System:
   - Updates dispute status to "resolved"
   - Adjusts specialist balance if applicable
   - Sends notifications to both parties
   - Records resolution for audit trail

## Requirements Fulfilled

### Requirement 7.1 ✅
- Dispute button visible on contract pages for in_progress and completed contracts

### Requirement 7.2 ✅
- Button hidden after 7 days from completion

### Requirement 7.3 ✅
- Dispute form with reason textarea implemented

### Requirement 7.4 ✅
- Contract status updated to "disputed" and dispute record created

### Requirement 7.5 ✅
- Admin panel displays list of active disputes

### Requirement 7.6 ✅
- Dispute details show full contract history and messages

### Requirement 7.7 ✅
- Resolution interface with action options (refund, pay, partial)

### Requirement 8.1 ✅
- Admin can update dispute status and execute payment actions

## Technical Highlights

1. **Time-based Visibility**: Dispute button uses date calculation to hide after 7 days
2. **Flexible Resolution**: Three payment options with automatic commission calculation
3. **Audit Trail**: All disputes and resolutions are permanently recorded
4. **Real-time Updates**: Uses Next.js revalidation for instant UI updates
5. **Notifications**: Both parties notified of resolution outcome
6. **Message History**: Admins can review full chat context
7. **Balance Management**: Automatic specialist balance updates based on resolution
8. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive validation and error messages

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Dispute Initiation**:
   - Test with in_progress contract
   - Test with completed contract (within 7 days)
   - Test with completed contract (after 7 days) - button should be hidden
   - Test with already disputed contract - button should be hidden

2. **Admin Resolution**:
   - Test full refund action
   - Test full payment action
   - Test partial split with various amounts
   - Test validation (empty notes, invalid amounts)
   - Verify balance updates correctly
   - Verify notifications are sent

3. **Message Viewer**:
   - Test with contract that has messages
   - Test with contract that has no messages
   - Verify correct sender identification

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - Multiple disputes on same contract (should be prevented)
   - Dispute on cancelled contract
   - Resolution by non-admin user (should fail)

## Files Modified
- `app/(student)/student/contracts/[id]/page.tsx` - Added dispute button and status

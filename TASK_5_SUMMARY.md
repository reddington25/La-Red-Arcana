## Next Steps
The admin panel foundation is complete. Future tasks will implement:
- Escrow management (Task 9)
- Dispute resolution (Task 12)
- Super admin functionality (Task 14)

## Testing Recommendations
1. Create test admin user in database
2. Create test unverified users (student and specialist)
3. Test verification flow end-to-end
4. Test badge grant/revoke functionality
5. Verify notifications are created correctly
6. Test mobile responsiveness
7. Verify role-based access control

## Notes
- Import errors in diagnostics are expected and will resolve when files are loaded
- Placeholder pages created for escrow and disputes (to be implemented in future tasks)
- All server actions include proper authorization checks
- UI follows the established Red Arcana design system
